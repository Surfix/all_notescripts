|Jan 01   | Park, Jongmin, Barton A. Forman, and Hans Lievens. "Prediction of active microwave backscatter over snow-covered terrain across Western Colorado using a land surface model and support vector machine regression." IEEE journal of selected topics in applied earth observations and remote sensing 14 (2021): 2403-2417. | Results | Wet-Dry snow delineation is important. Combining ascending and descending acqusiitions results in higher bias due to complexity of the signal from different acquisition times and geometry. Sentinel-1 show higher sensitivity to wet snow.

Remote Sensing, 14(23), 5930. | Results; Conclusion | The study found that introducing forest phase model reduces underestimation of snow depth in forest areas. This sound counter intuitive. Considering interception effect, snow depth should be overestimated in forest areas if at all there is forest impact. How about doing some forest bias analysis and validatimg this method??? |

Cambridge University Press. | 1 - Introduction {1.1: perception of snow, 1.2: History of Snow Hydrology, 1.3: Snow Hydrology Research Basin, 1.4: properties of water, ice and snow} | Snow is somehow underappreciated. The signifcance snow to transport mobility, infrastructure is however appreciated in areas that experience severe snow sturm. Snow is an important source of water in many areas. Snow is vital component of earth climate system. It is an important insulating cover for some organisms. Veru crucial input to the General Circulation Model (GCM) |
| Jan 05 | DeWalle, D. R., & Rango, A. (2008). Principles of snow hydrology. Cambridge University Press. | 2 Snow Climatology and snow distribution {2.1: Snowfall formation} | Snow is formed from the condensation of atmospheric water vapor so requires sufficient moist air and air temperature (function of latitude and altitude) that is well above freezing. The nature of air mass circulation controls the saturation of the air with water vapor thus ultimately controls snow climatology |

Cambridge University Press. | 2 Snow Climatology and snow distribution { 2.1.1: Ice crystal and snowfall formation in clouds, 2.1.2: Orographic lifting, 2.1.3: Frontal activity, 2.1.4: Convergence, 2.1.5: Lake-effect snowfalls, 2.1.6: El Nina/La Nina Souther Oscillation effects} | Tiny water droplets and ice crystals coexist in cold clouds at same temperature. There is dynamic interaction between this two phases of water leading to the growing of ice at the expense of water vapor in what is called a Burgeon process. Ultimately, mountains, air movements, lakes provide the conditions for the uplifting of warm air masses that condenses, freezes and eventually go through burgeon process for snowflake formation |

Cambridge University Press. |{2.2: Blowing snow (modes of blowing snow, factors influencing blowing snow, aublimation of blowing snow, modeling blowing snow), 2.3: Snow interception by vegetation(factors affecting snow interception, mopdeling snow interception, applications in snow hydrology)} | Wind transport snow before sublimation or it becomes snowpack. Vegetaion and meteorological factors control interception. Total SWE  = throughfall + stemflow + canopy interception loss.

Cambridge University Press. | 3- Snowpack conditions {3.1 : Snowpack metamorphism (formation of rounded grains in dry snow, formation of faceted grains in dry snow, wet snow metamorphism, other snowpack transformation, snowpack density and densification, international classification system for seasonal snow cover), 3.2 : Heat conduction in the snowpack, 3.3 : snowpack temperature and cold content, 3.4 : Liquid water in snow (Liquid water content of snow, theory of water movement)} 5- Remote sensing of the snowpack | Metamorphism control the thermal conductivity and liquid permeability of the snow. Snow grains due to their large surface area to volume ratiocan easily be transformed to rounded or facetted grains. Rounded grains can be formed from the migration of vapour from convex to concave ice surface as a result of vapour pressure gradient which may occur when there are no temperature different within the snowpack so this is called equitemperature metamorphism. vapour diffusion leads to sintering: formation of bonds among adjacent ice grains. Vapour diffusuion can also occur due to temperature gradient. However, temperature gradient mostly results in formation of faceted grains.  Faceted grains are not well bounded because sublimation occurs at the base of the ice grains rather than at the point of contact so they can lead to structural weakness within the snowpack and avalanche problems. Occurence of melting and refreezing can also affect oce grains size, shape and bonding. Large ice grains cannibalizes small ice grains. There can also be other transformations such as windslab near the ssurface, ice lenses on or near the surface, surface hoar. Densification reflects influence of all the metamorphic processes. Heat transfer along a temperature gradient occur by conduction (through solid ice and air in snowpack pores) and latent heat exchange due to molecular diffusion of water vapour. Radiation transmission and convection can also be responsible for energy transfer. Liquid water in snow will first satisfy snowpack cold condition and liquid water holding capacity. The remaining liquid water will percolate vertically downward through the snowpack to the soil surface and can flow downslope through the basal layers
