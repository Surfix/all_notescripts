Combining ascending and descending acqusiitions results in higher bias due to complexity of the signal from different acquisition times and geometry. Sentinel-1 show higher sensitivity to wet snow.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

This sound counter intuitive. Considering interception effect, snow depth should be overestimated in forest areas if at all there is forest impact. How about doing some forest bias analysis and validatimg this method???                                                                                                            |

The signifcance snow to transport mobility, infrastructure is however appreciated in areas that experience severe snow sturm. Snow is an important source of water in many areas. Snow is vital component of earth climate system. It is an important insulating cover for some organisms.

The nature of air mass circulation controls the saturation of the air with water vapor thus ultimately controls snow climatology                                                                                                                            |

There is dynamic interaction between this two phases of water leading to the growing of ice at the expense of water vapor in what is called a Burgeon process. Ultimately, mountains, air movements, lakes provide the conditions for the uplifting of warm air masses that condenses, freezes and eventually go through burgeon process for snowflake formation |
