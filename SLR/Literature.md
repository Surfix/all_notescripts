"Prediction of active microwave backscatter over snow-covered terrain across Western Colorado using a land surface model and support vector machine regression." IEEE journal of selected topics in applied earth observations and remote sensing 14 (2021): 2403-2417. | Results                                                                                                                                                | Wet-Dry snow delineation is important. Combining ascending and descending acqusiitions results in higher bias due to complexity of the signal from different acquisition times and geometry. Sentinel-1 show higher sensitivity to wet snow.                                                                                                                                           |

This sound counter intuitive. Considering interception effect, snow depth should be overestimated in forest areas if at all there is forest impact. How about doing some forest bias analysis and validatimg this method???                                                 |

The signifcance snow to transport mobility, infrastructure is however appreciated in areas that experience severe snow sturm. Snow is an important source of water in many areas. Snow is vital component of earth climate system. It is an important insulating cover for some organisms. Veru crucial input to the General Circulation Model (GCM) |

The nature of air mass circulation controls the saturation of the air with water vapor thus ultimately controls snow climatology                                                                 |
