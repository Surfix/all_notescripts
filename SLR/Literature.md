| Jan-01 | Park, Jongmin, Barton A. Forman, and Hans Lievens. "Prediction of active microwave backscatter over snow-covered terrain across Western Colorado using a land surface model and support vector machine regression." IEEE journal of selected topics in applied earth observations and remote sensing 14 (2021): 2403-2417. | Results | Wet-Dry snow delineation is important. Combining ascending and descending acqusiitions results in higher bias due to  complexity of the signal from different acquisition times and geometry. Sentinel-1 show higher sensitivity to wet snow. | 
| Jan-02 | Li, Y., Zhao, X., & Zhao, Q. (2022). Snow Depth Inversion in Forest Areas from Sentinel-1 Data Based on Phase Deviation Correction. Remote Sensing, 14(23), 5930. | Introduction; Methodology | Estimated forest contribution by using phase difference from open and forest snow covered regions | 
| Jan-03 | Li, Y., Zhao, X., & Zhao, Q. (2022). Snow Depth Inversion in Forest Areas from Sentinel-1 Data Based on Phase Deviation Correction. Remote Sensing, 14(23), 5930. | Results; Conclusion | The study found that introducing forest phase model reduces underestimation of snow depth in forest areas. This sound counter intuitive. Considering interception effect, snow depth should be overestimated in forest areas if at all there is forest impact. How about doing some forest bias analysis and validatimg this method??? |
