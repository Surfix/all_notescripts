| Jan-01 | Park, Jongmin, Barton A. Forman, and Hans Lievens. "Prediction of active microwave backscatter over snow-covered terrain across Western Colorado using a land surface model and support vector machine regression." IEEE journal of selected topics in applied earth observations and remote sensing 14 (2021): 2403-2417. | Results | Wet-Dry snow delineation is important. Combining ascending and descending acqusiitions results in higher bias due to  complexity of the signal from different acquisition times and geometry. Sentinel-1 show higher sensitivity to wet snow. |
